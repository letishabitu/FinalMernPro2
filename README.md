# This is a project about an insurance company . I have used, React App for fron end. 
#I used Express and node.js for backend 
#I used mangodb for database. 
#I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKs2IZZya7c as a Guide. 
the constraints are:
  * after the user logs in, we have to refresh for the token to get included on the browser.
  * searching the database is not filtered.
  * i didn't spend much time on styling,
  * the logout button is not working after the user creates the service.

this software is still under development, and I will continue working to fix the above constraints.
